# This is my first React app

This is an application that reads .json file and stores the information into the table.
You can sort the information by different values in ascending or descending order, change the view (the table or the tiles with video) and change the language.

## Getting started


To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all req'd dependencies
